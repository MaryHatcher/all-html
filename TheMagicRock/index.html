They used to live in a <input type="text" placeholder="type of house"> in <input type="text" placeholder="name of town"> and eat <input type="text" placeholder="type of food"> every day until they found a(n) <input type="text" placeholder="adjective"> rock in their <input type="text" placeholder="type of room">. They picked up this rock and <input type="text" placeholder="past-tense verb"> it. After that, they felt <input type="text" placeholder="adjective"> for a couple of <input type="text" placeholder="unit of time">s until they noticed that they started growing an extra <input type="text" placeholder="body part">.
